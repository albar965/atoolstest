# Build Instructions

The atools static library is required. Clone atools (`git clone https://github.com/albar965/atools.git`)
and follow the build instructions there. The instructions in this `BUILD.txt` file assume that atools was installed
and compiled successfully and Qt Creator was configured accordingly.

Clone the atoolstest GIT repository into the same directory as atools. You can use another
directory but then you need to adapt the configuration by changing environment variables.

Look at the `atoolstest.pro` file. There is a list of documented environment variables that can
be set to customize the build. Most of these variables are optional and use a reasonable default
value. Set these variables in the Qt Creator GUI or on the command line.

There is no need to edit the `*.pro` files.

## Default paths and Environment Variables

The projects can be built with almost no configuration changes since all project files fall back to sensible
default paths if the corresponding environment variables are not set. `APROJECTS` is the placeholder for the base directory in
the examples below. Avoid paths with spaces if possible.

* `APROJECTS/atools/src`                   Sources. `ATOOLS_INC_PATH`
* `APROJECTS/build-atools-debug`           atools debug build. `ATOOLS_LIB_PATH`
* `APROJECTS/build-atools-release`         atools release build. `ATOOLS_LIB_PATH`
* `APROJECTS/build-atoolstest-debug`       atoolstest debug build.
* `APROJECTS/build-atoolstest-release`     atoolstest release build.
* `APROJECTS/deploy`                       Target for `make deploy`. `DEPLOY_BASE`
* `APROJECTS/atoolstest`                   Sources.

## Windows

- Clone atoolstest from GIT (`git clone https://github.com/albar965/atoolstest.git`)
  to e.g.: `C:\Projects\atoolstest`
- For atoolstest use the build directory of e.g.: `C:\Projects\build-atoolstest-release`. Otherwise
  change the paths with envronment variables (see `atoolstest.pro` file).
- Import atoolstest into the Qt Creator workspace (atools should be already there).
- Configure the project and enable the shadow build for release or debug versions.
- Set the build kit for atools and atoolstest to MinGW 32bit.
- Run qmake from Qt Creator for all projects
- Build all projects from Qt Creator
- Create and run the target `deploy`. This will create a directory `DEPLOY_BASE\atoolstest` with the program.

The atoolstest project can be built using the MinGW environment only. MSVC will not work.

## Linux

Install Qt development packages. Version at least 5.6.

You can build the program on Linux or macOS similar to the Windows instructions above either using
the Qt Creator GUI or the command line.

The following assumes that atools was already installed and built.

### To build the atoolstest release version:

```
mkdir build-atoolstest-release
cd build-atoolstest-release
qmake ../atoolstest/atoolstest.pro CONFIG+=release
make
```

### To build the atoolstest debug version:

```
mkdir build-atoolstest-debug
cd build-atoolstest-debug
qmake ../atoolstest/atoolstest.pro CONFIG+=debug
make
```
